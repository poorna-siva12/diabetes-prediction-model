# Clinical Diabetes Prediction

This project showcases a clinical prediction model for diabetes using Python. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the choice of various machine learning or deep learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks. You can use this code as a starting point for clinical prediction tasks.

## Dataset
The Diabetes dataset from Scikit-Learn is used for this example. The data is preprocessed for binary classification (diabetes or not).

## Usage
1. Install the required libraries.
2. Run the code to train and evaluate different models.
3. Modify the model and hyperparameters for your specific clinical prediction task.
